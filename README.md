# Secureum CARE-X: Certora Prover and AAVE

Secureum is collaborating with Certora and Aave to further accelerate Certora's "Continuous Formal Verification" of the Aave protocol (see Certora-Aave grant details: https://governance.aave.com/t/continuous-formal-verification/6308).

Certora has recently received, via a governance proposal, an Aave grant for Continuous Formal Verification and Certora Prover Education focussed on the Aave protocol and is executing this in collaboration with the Aave community and the BGD initiative (https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-bored-ghosts-developing-bgd/7527).

A significant focus of this grant is the Certora Prover Education to educate and encourage the community towards understanding security properties of the Aave ecosystem and writing Certora Prover rules for verifying them. Certora has led many education initiatives towards achieving this goal.

### Youtube Videos
- "Auditing and Formal Verification - Better together" âœ… https://youtu.be/VGSsPIsbb6U by @Mooly (CEO, Certora) is a great high-level overview of formal verification (FV) and its application to DeFi. Good place to start. Talks about key concepts of:

    1. FV vs Auditing
    2. Spec vs Code
    3. Concept of invariants; DeFi invariants
    4. Examples with SushiSwap

- "Move Fast and Break Nothing" https://youtu.be/hSH0UbwEvU4 by Michael George is another quick overview of Certora Prover and talks specifically about the SushiSwap Trident bug (caught by Prover) where the constant product invariant was broken.
